## Description

My motivation for this project was to utilize my knowledge of flex box, media queries, and CSS variables to create a portfolio of work where I can showcase my skills and talents to employers. I built this project to highlight my strongest work and also to have a place where someone can find all of my deployed applications on the one webpage. This solves a problem with having a lot of different links to various projects by having them all in the one place and also shows that I can optimize a webpage for different screen sizes.
